CSV
---

This module provides functions for reading and writing Comma Delimited
Value (CSV) files.  The module allows the delimiter to be changed from
a comma to some other character or set of characters.  It also
provides functions for validating the CSV file's field list.  Bug
reports and discussions about these modules can still be sent to
Christotpher Rath <Christopher@Rath.ca>.

A small application to demonstrate how to use the module is included;
located in the Demo_App directory.  It is not installed by the
instructions, below; rather, it is left in the distribution directory
for your examination.
