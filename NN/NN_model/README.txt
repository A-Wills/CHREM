This folder includes 3 folders.

NN_annual_energy_calc: Included are all required files to run a simulation using
	the PERL scripts to determine annual energy consumption of the ALC, DHW, and SH, 
	corresponding with Merih Aydinalp's 2002 PhD Thesis from Dalhousie University.
	The input files may be altered to represent appropriate dwellings and rerun to obtain
	new results

The remaining folders allow the NN results to be applied to appropriate usage profiles


All models are run using PERL scripts and utilize datasets and data which are included.
To run PERL see www.perl.com
