These climate CWEC files come from a checkout of esp-r:
svn co https://esp-r.net/espr/extras/climate

Alex Ferguson wrote a script to extract these weather files for the specified country using the esp-r clm tool.
This is a very slick operation.

NOTE: the CWEC files require that the solar timing hour be centred. This is adjusted in the cfg file of a house model.
*slr_half_hr 1

Also included in this folder is a csv file that cross references the many locations in Canada to the nearest weather site.
The file includes the province and city name, as well as lat and long, and the corresponding CWEC weather file with its lat and long.
