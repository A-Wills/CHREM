2 # total number of classes
#
# Material classes are listed as follows:
#	*class, 'class number'(2 digits),'number of materials in class','class name'
#	'class description
#
# Materials within each class are listed as follows:
#	*item,'material name','material number'(20 * 'class number' + 'material position within class'; 3 digits),'class number'(2 digits),'material description'
# The material tag is followed by the following material attributes:
#	conductivity (W/(m-K), density (kg/m**3), specific heat (J/(kg-K),
#	emissivity out (-), emissivity in (-), absorptivity out, (-) absorptivity in (-),
#	diffusion resistance (?), default thickness (mm),
#	flag [-] legacy [o] opaque [t] transparent [g] gas data+T cor [h] gas data at 4T
#
#	transparent material include additional attributes:
#		longwave tran (-), solar direct tran (-), solar reflec out (-), solar refled in (-),
#		visable tran (-), visable reflec out (-), visable reflec in (-), colour rendering (-)
