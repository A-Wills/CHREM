NOTE THAT THE DHW ORIGINALLY HAD DOS END OF LINE CHARACTERS. CHECK THIS IF HAVING ISSUES.

The can_gen are generated appliance and lighting (AL) contains power profiles for use with ESP-r. 
These are listed in Watts with 12 timesteps per hour (row), each for 5 minutes, resulting in 1 h per row.
There is 8760 lines corresponding to each hour of a year.


The domestic hot water (DHW) files are the water draw in L/h listing in columnar format for the associated XXDHW00Y.txt file
XX is the timestep minutes that each datapoint represents
Y refers as follows
	1 = 100 L/day average
	2 = 200 L/day average
	3 = 300 L/day average

The 5 minute timestep data does not appear in the original reports. It is likely that someone made these using the SuperPon.exe tool.
